# Product Context: Text Mate Frontend

## Why This Project Exists
Text Mate addresses the growing need for sophisticated text editing and correction tools in professional and academic environments. Traditional text editors lack advanced AI-powered correction, while specialized tools often require separate workflows. Text Mate integrates these capabilities into a single, cohesive interface.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Fragmented Writing Workflows**: Users typically switch between multiple tools for grammar checking, rewriting, and document validation
2. **Language Barriers**: Multilingual users need robust correction and rewriting capabilities across different languages
3. **Document Compliance**: Professionals need to validate documents against specific reference materials and style guides
4. **Specialized Vocabulary**: Industries and organizations require custom dictionaries for technical terms and jargon
5. **Real-time Feedback**: Writers need immediate correction suggestions without disrupting their creative flow

## How It Should Work
### Core User Experience
- **Immediate Text Analysis**: As users type, text is automatically analyzed for grammar, spelling, and style issues
- **Non-intrusive Corrections**: Suggestions appear in a side panel, allowing users to focus on writing
- **Contextual Rewriting**: AI-powered rewriting considers style, audience, and intent parameters
- **Document Validation**: Users can upload reference PDFs and validate their text against these documents
- **Seamless Integration**: All features work together without requiring context switching

### Interaction Patterns
- **Split-view Interface**: Left panel for writing, right panel for tools and suggestions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features are available but don't overwhelm new users
- **Keyboard-first Design**: Power users can navigate efficiently without mouse dependency
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for corrections, changes, and system status

## User Experience Goals
### Primary Goals
- **Maintain Writing Flow**: Corrections should enhance, not interrupt, the writing process
- **Build User Trust**: Suggestions should be accurate, relevant, and explainable
- **Enable Learning**: Users should understand why corrections are suggested
- **Support Professional Workflows**: Tools should integrate into existing professional processes

### Secondary Goals
- **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Interface should be clean and predictable
- **Provide Customization**: Users should be able to tailor corrections to their needs
- **Ensure Accessibility**: All users should be able to use the application effectively
- **Maintain Performance**: Real-time features should not impact typing responsiveness

## Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: Time spent in application, frequency of use
- **Correction Acceptance Rate**: Percentage of suggested corrections users accept
- **Task Completion Time**: How quickly users can complete writing and correction tasks
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on accuracy, usefulness, and overall experience
- **Error Reduction**: Improvement in text quality metrics over time

## Competitive Landscape
Text Mate differentiates itself by:
- Combining multiple text processing capabilities in one interface
- Real-time processing with sophisticated AI integration
- Document validation against reference materials
- Professional-grade features with consumer-friendly usability
- Open-source architecture with enterprise-ready capabilities
